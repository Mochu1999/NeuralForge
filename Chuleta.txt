Batches to avoid fitting to just your last sample and you train faster. Batches of 32,64. Rarely 128

Although inputs are shown graphically as collumns, they are rows in the matrix.

The weights for a neuron are shown in collumns. 

All matrices are row major. columns determined by matrix.size() and rows by matrix[0].size()


Deep learning is when there are more than 2 hidden layers

Classification is a type of neural network that assigns the input data into defined categories,
Regression gives them a numerical value and clustering groups similar data together without predefined values

Dense layers are the layers where each neuron is connected to every neuron of the next layer

Activation functions include both step functions and Rectified Linear (ReLU) function

Softmax is an activation function for the output layer. The objetive is to classificate and exponentiating
 removes the negative values while assigning more value to larger outputs.

Softmax mixes well with cross-entropy loss because this last one uses a natural log
